# Message display settings

![Message Display](/static/images/help/message-display-settings.png)

By default, messages in Zulip are displayed in English with a 12-hour
timestamp, and the user list is displayed on the right side of the
window.

However, there are a few reasons you might want to modify your message
display settings. For example, you may want to do this if you speak a
non-English language as your first language, are used to a 24-hour
convention for displaying time, or have a narrow screen and want to
conserve space.

## Display options

Listed below are the current message display settings that Zulip
supports. After editing your message display settings, you will need
to reload your screen for any changes you make to take effect.

### Select default language

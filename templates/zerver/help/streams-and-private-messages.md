# Streams and private messages

![Streams and private messages overview](/static/images/help/streams-private-overview.png)

Zulip supports both **private messaging** and group chats via conversation **streams**.

**Streams** are either:
* **Public** - Public streams are for open discussions. All users can
  subscribe to public streams and discuss there. Any Zulip user can
  join any public stream in the realm, and can view the complete
  message history of any public stream without joining the stream.
* **Private** - Private streams are for confidential discussions and
  are only visible to users who've been invited to subscribe to
  them. Users who are not members of a private stream cannot subscribe
  to the stream or read or send messages in the stream.

**Private messaging** can either be done in a **one-on-one** or in a
  **group** conversation. They can only be seen by users that are in
  the group.

in composing your message.

uploading it to Zulip to share with your peers.

While the file is uploading, a blue box labeled **Uploading...** will

the file has been uploaded.

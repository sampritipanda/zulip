# Allow anyone to join without an invitation

By default, new users can join a Zulip organization with or without an email
invitation.

However, if you are an organization administrator that wants to limit
the membership of your organization, you can choose to limit new
members to those with email invitations.

## Limiting new membership to users invited by organization members

{!admin.md!}

4. Locate the **E-mail invitation required** checkbox.

    To limit new members of your organization to those who have been
    invited to do so, click the **E-mail invitation required** checkbox.

    New users will now require an email invitation sent by a user in your Zulip
organization to join your organization.

    * If you wish to further limit new membership to your organization, you can
    [only allow administrators](/help/only-allow-admins-to-invite-new-users) in
    your organization to send email invitations to new users.

5. To save any changes you have made to your organization settings, click the
**Save changes** button at the bottom of the **Organizations settings**
section.

# Private Group Messages
## There are three ways to send a private message to a group of people:
### First Way:
To send a new private group message,
first click on the `New private message`
button located at the bottom of your screen.

The following box will be displayed:

In the **one or more people...** field,
input the usernames or email addresses of the users
you want to send a private group message to.
Each username or email address should be separated by a comma (`,`).
When you begin typing an email address or username,
autocomplete suggestions will appear for individuals.
The list of users in this field creates the group
to which the private message will be sent.

If you attempt to input a nonexistent username or email address,
an error message will appear.

### Second Way:
If you have already private messaged a group of people,
their names will appear under the **Group PMs** heading
at the bottom of the user list on the right side of your screen.

Clicking on one of the groups will bring up a messaging box.
The **one or more people...** field will automatically be filled
with the users in that existing group.

You can then type your message to that group of users
in the **Compose your message here...** field.

### Third Way:
Within the **Private messages** tab on the left of the screen, you can view and respond to group messages.

Clicking on the **Private messages** tab will show all of your private
messages in the center of your screen.

![Private messages](/static/images/help/private-messages.png)

Clicking on a message from a private group in this view
will bring up a messaging box with the **one or more people...** field
filled with the users in that group.
You can then type a message to that group in the
**Compose your message here...** field.

Also, you can see your a list of your private group messages under
**Private messages**
at the top left corner of your screen.

![Groups left sidebar](/static/images/help/groups-left-sidebar.png)

Clicking on one of these groups will narrow to that group.
Now, if you click the `New private message` button
at the bottom of your screen,
the **one or more people...** field will automatically be filled with
the users in that private group.
Alternatively, you can click on a message from a group
to bring up a messaging box with the **one or more people...** field
filled with the users in that private group message.

    At any time you can discard your message by clicking the **x**
    (<i class="icon-vector-remove"></i>) icon
    located at the top-right corner of the compose box.

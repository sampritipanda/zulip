# Private Message

Zulip allows users to send private messages to each other.

## There are two ways to send a Private Message:

### Way 1:

* To submit a new private message, first click on the `New Private
  Message` button located at the bottom of your screen.

* The following box will be displayed
![New stream message](/static/images/help/private-box.png)

* In the **one or more people...** field, input the username or email
address of the user you want to privately message.  When you begin
typing an email address or username, autocomplete suggestions will
appear.

* If you attempt to input a nonexistent username or email address, an
  error message will appear.

### Way 2:

* You also can click on the **user's name** in the `USERS` panel on
the right and click on `down arrow` that gets visible when hovering
over the name and click on the option `Compose a private message to
<user's name>` and write the message in the compose box.

You can always discard your message by clicking the **x**
(<i class="icon-vector-remove"></i>) icon located at the top-right corner
of your compose box.

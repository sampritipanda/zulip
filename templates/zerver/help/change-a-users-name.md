# Change a user's name
An administrator can change the name of another user. Ordinary users can
[change their own names](/help/change-your-name), but administrators can change
users' names when users are unavailable.

Follow the following steps to change the name of a user using an administrator account.

{!go-to-the.md!} [Users](/#administration/user-list-admin)
{!admin.md!}

2. Click on the pencil (<i class="icon-vector-pencil"></i>) icon next to
the name of the user you want to change.

3. After clicking on the pencil icon, an input field labeled **Full name** will
appear to allow you to change the user's name. Enter the user's new name in
**Full name**.

4. After editing the name of the user, you can save the changes you made by
clicking on the **Save Changes** button.

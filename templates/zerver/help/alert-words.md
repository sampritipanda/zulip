# Alert Words
Zulip allows you to define custom alert words and phrases.
When they are used in any stream you are subscribed to, it works
similarly to being [@-mentioned](/help/at-mention-a-team-member)
by another user.

## Adding Alert Words
{!go-to-the.md!} [Custom Alert Words](/#settings/custom-alert-words)
{!settings.md!}

2.  Type the word/phrase you wish to be notified for into the text box,
    then click the **Add Alert Word** button.

Once these steps are completed, you should see something similar to:

![Alert Settings](/static/images/help/settings-custom-alerts-sample.png)

If any alert words are mentioned, they will be highlighted within the message,
and you will be alerted in accordance with your notification settings.

## Removing Alert Words

Alert Words can be removed easily in the settings menu, by clicking the
red bin button (![Trash Can](/static/images/help/delete-button.png))
next to the word/phrase to be deleted.

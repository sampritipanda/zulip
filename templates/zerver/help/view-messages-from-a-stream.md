# View messages from a stream

![home view](/static/images/help/home-view.png)

In the home view, you'll see messages from all streams and topics. However,
you may only want to see messages from a single stream. This is also
called 'narrowing' to a stream.

To view messages from a stream, select the stream from the stream list on
the left.

!!! tip ""
    Only messages from the selected stream will be displayed.
    In the stream list, the stream whose messages are
    currently being viewed will be highlighted in blue, and
    the topics in that
    stream will be displayed below the stream name.

An alternative way to view messages from only one stream is to type
**stream:** in the search bar at the top, and then enter the name of the
stream whose messages you want to view. Use the autocomplete feature to
narrow to a stream.

You can view any messages from a subscribed or public stream, but
you'll generally want to subscribe to
streams whose messages you want to view.

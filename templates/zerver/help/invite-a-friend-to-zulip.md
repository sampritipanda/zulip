# Invite a friend to Zulip

By default, all users in a Zulip organization can invite users to
their Zulip organization. To do so, simply follow the following steps.

1. Click the cog (<i class="icon-vector-cog"></i>) in the upper
   right corner of the right sidebar.

2. Select **Invite users** from the dropdown menu that appears.

   users to Zulip** will appear.

4. In the box labeled **Emails (one on each line or
   comma-separated)**, enter the email addresses of the users that you
   want to invite. Insert a comma or a separate line between each
   email.

5. In the section labeled **Streams they should join**, select the
   options of any streams that you want the users you invite to be
   subscribed to by default. Only streams that you're subscribed to
   are displayed; the **Check all** option selects all streams, while
   the **Uncheck all** option deselects all streams.

6. After you have finished inputting all fields, click the blue
   **Invite** button in the bottom right corner. A section labeled
   **Users invited successfully.** will appear in the modal to confirm
   the success of your invitation.

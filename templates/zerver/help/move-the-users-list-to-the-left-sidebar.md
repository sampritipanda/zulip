# Move the user list to the left sidebar

By default, the **Users** list is displayed on the right side of the
Zulip window.  On mobile devices with narrow screens, the **Users**
list is hidden to save space.  If you would like to see the **Users**
list on your mobile device, you can choose to move it to the left side
of the screen.

You can easily change the location of the **Users** list by following a few steps.

{!settings.md!}

2. Select the option labeled **Display user list on left side in
   narrow windows**, then reload the page in order for the change to
   take effect.

    When this option is selected, the user list located on the right by
    default will be listed under the **Streams** section in the left
    sidebar when the window size is under 1165 pixels.

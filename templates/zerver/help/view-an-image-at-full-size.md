# View an image at full size

When someone sends an image in a Zulip chat, the image preview will be
generated in the chat itself, but if you want to see the image at
full size, you just have to click on it.

![preview](/static/images/help/image-preview.png)

Your screen will look like this:

![full-size](/static/images/help/full-size.png)

From here, you can also open the image in a new tab or download
it. These options can be seen in the top right of your screen.

Click the **X** in the top right to return to your Zulip chat.

<p>
  First, create a stream where you would like to receive Greenhouse
  notifications and subscribe all interested parties to the
  stream. The integration will automatically use the default
  stream <code>greenhouse</code> if no stream is supplied, though you
  will still need to create the stream manually even though it's the
  default.
</p>

<p>
  Next, go to the Zulip settings page and create a bot named
  Greenhouse. Go to the account settings page of your Greenhouse
  account and under Webhooks, add the below URL and name the
  integration, Zulip.
</p>

<p><code>{{ external_api_uri_subdomain }}/v1/external/greenhouse?api_key=abcdefgh&amp;stream=greenhouse</code></p>

<p>
  Note: <code>api_key</code> must be reconfigured to be the API key of your Zulip bot.<br />
  If you want to change the stream that receives notifications, change <code>stream=</code> in the URL. <br />
  To change the topic displayed by the bot, simply append <code>&amp;topic=name</code> to the end of the above URL.
  Where <code>name</code> is your topic.
</p>

  <b>Congratulations! You're all set</b><br />
  Your messages should look like this:
